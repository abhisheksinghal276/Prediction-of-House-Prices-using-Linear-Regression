# Prediction-of-House-Prices-using-Linear-Regression
In this project, we will predict the house prices in USA using the dataset provided by Udemy as the course content using Linear Regression.The data contains the following columns:

- 'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
- 'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
- 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
- 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
- 'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
- 'Price': Price that the house sold at
- 'Address': Address for the house

**Use case for the model:**
- This model can help the buyers and sellers to buy and sell their houses at the most accurate price.
- It also will help them to avoid paying the wrong prices leading to saving on house cost.
